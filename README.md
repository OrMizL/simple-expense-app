# Simple Expense App
This is a very simple expense app, inspired by Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy.

Release 1.0.0 includes all the basic stuff, a list of transactions, adding a new transaction, deleting an existing one, styling, inputs and more.

The intention is to expand on the existing and add more functions and versitility.
